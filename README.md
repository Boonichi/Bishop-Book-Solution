# Bishop-Book-Solution
## Introduction
This is Solution of the book [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf). The reason that I create this project, is just for learning Math in machine learning and Latex.

The book is not completed so I haven't formatted the Book File. Contacting me if you want to learn together.
